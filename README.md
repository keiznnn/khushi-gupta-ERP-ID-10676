# 🚨 Danger Zone Detection System (C Mini Project)

## 📌 Overview  
The Danger Zone Detection System is a beginner-friendly C mini project that uses a 2D array to represent an area in the form of a grid. Each cell in the grid represents a zone:

- `0` → Safe Zone  
- `1` → Danger Zone  

The program scans the entire grid and identifies all positions where danger is present. It displays the row and column of each danger zone and also shows the total number of danger zones detected.

---

## 🎯 Objective  
- Understand the practical use of 2D arrays  
- Learn matrix traversal using nested loops  
- Use functions for modular programming  
- Simulate a simple real-world monitoring system  

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used  
- Language: **C**  
- Tools: **VS Code /  (GCC, Turbo C, etc.)**

---

## ⚙ How It Works  
1. The user enters the number of rows and columns.  
2. The user inputs `0` or `1` for each cell.  
3. The program displays the complete grid.  
4. The system scans the grid using nested loops.  
5. Every cell with value `1` is reported as a danger zone.  
6. The total number of danger zones is displayed.

## 🧪 Sample Input  
Rows: 3
Columns: 3

1 0 0
0 1 0
0 0 1


## 📤 Sample Output  

Danger detected at -> Row 1, Column 1
Danger detected at -> Row 2, Column 2
Danger detected at -> Row 3, Column 3

Total Danger Zones: 3
